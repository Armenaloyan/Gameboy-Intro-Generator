# Gameboy-Intro-Generator
Creates a GIF of text that looks like a game boy boot sequence

# Instructions
To use, simply edit the TITLE, SUBTITLE, and color palette as desired. When the sketch is run, a squence of images will be generated that can be made into a movie with the built-in tool, or anything else the user prefers. I'd like to have a gif generated by the software itself, but that would require the upgrading of an entire library from Processing v2. 

# Credits
Built on [Processing](https://processing.org) v3.3.6. The font used was created by Jimmy Campbell and available for download [here](https://www.dafont.com/early-gameboy.font).
