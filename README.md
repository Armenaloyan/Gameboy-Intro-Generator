# Gameboy-Intro-Generator
Creates a GIF of text that looks like a Game Boy Color boot sequence.
Currently made for programmers that can edit the data, not end-users. 

# Instructions
To use, simply edit the TITLE, SUBTITLE, and color palette as desired. Once the sketch is run, a gif will be generated in the sketch folder if
SAVEGIF is set to `true`, and individual frames can be saved if SAVEFRAMES is
set. This is useful if you want to create a video using processing's build in
movie maker tool. 

# Credits
Built on [Processing](https://processing.org) v3.3.6. GIF library for
Processing 3 can be found [here](https://github.com/01010101/GifAnimation). The font used was created by Jimmy Campbell and available for download [here](https://www.dafont.com/early-gameboy.font).
